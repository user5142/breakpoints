            <p>The average person maintains 100 password protected account logins, according to 2020 research conducted by <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person" target="_blank">NordPass</a>.</p>
            <p>I personally have 75 logins saved to my password manager, and that’s after going on an intense digital account pruning campaign a few months back.</p>
            <p>With this rise in account logins, it has become increasingly important to implement strong password management and security strategies.</p>
            <p>Around 6 months ago, I went deep down the password security rabbit hole to devise a robust strategy for managing and securing my passwords. I feel much more peace of mind these days having implemented a solid process, and managing my accounts has become a breeze.</p>
            <p>Revamping your password security requires some considerable upfront work, but it is more than worth the effort, and I am here to help.</p>
            <p>Here are 5 password management and strengthening tactics that can be implemented across households and organizations alike.</p>
            <h3>1) Enable two-factor authentication</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication" target="_blank">Two-factor authentication</a> is a security process in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves.</p>
            <p>Enabling two-factor authentication is one of the lowest hanging fruit opportunities to improve account security.</p>
            <p>Many digital services and businesses enable two-factor authentication by default these days. Other services leave it as an option to be enabled, and some don’t offer it as an option at all.</p>
            <p>I would recommend switching on two-factor authentication across as many of your accounts as possible. It is a quick and simple way to add an extra layer of security  to your data, regardless of your password strength.</p>
            <p>Two-factor authentication slightly decreases convenience, but greatly increases security – a very worthy trade-off in my opinion.</p>
            <h3>2) Use a password manager</h3>
            <p>A <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager" target="_blank">password manager</a> is a software application designed to store and manage online credentials.</p>
            <p>Utilizing a password manager is a great way to boost both convenience and security for your online accounts.</p>
            <p>With a password manager, you only need to remember one password: your master key. This is a single password that grants you access to all of your stored account information.</p>
            <p>Industry-leading password managers like my personal favorite, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank">Bitwarden</a>, use military-grade encryption in their products. Your passwords and sensitive data are strongly encrypted before they are sent and stored to any servers.</p>
            <p>Password managers are not <a href="https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/are-password-managers-safe/" target="_blank">without risk</a>, but they are a great step towards securing your most sensitive data and establishing a sustainable account management process.</p>
            <h3>3) Use unique passwords</h3>
            <p>A <a href="https://resources.yubico.com/53ZDUYE6/at/q3tmql-974v8g-73e8p5/YubicoPonemon_2019_State_of_Password_and_Authentication_Security_Behaviors_Report.pdf?format=pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted across 1,761 people by the Ponemon Institute revealed that 51% of respondents reuse passwords across their digital accounts.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, all of these survey participants were IT industry professionals. This leads me to believe the percentage of the general population who reuse passwords is likely much higher.</p>
            <p>Making sure to use 100% unique passwords across all of your accounts is a crucial tactic for securing your sensitive data.</p>
            <p>At this stage of the digital age, we have all likely been recipients of the tail-between-the-legs mass email from a company indicating that our account credentials have been compromised in a data breach. </p>
            <p>Using unique passwords will ensure that hackers can’t easily hop from one of your accounts to another once they have one of your login credentials in hand.</p>
            <p>In addition to being unique, passwords should be as strong and complex as possible. To take the guesswork out of the equation, I use <a href="https://passwordwolf.com/" target="_blank">Password Wolf</a>, a random password generator created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrhysider?lang=en" target="_blank">Jack Rhysider</a>.</p>
            <h3>4) Use password peppers</h3>
            <p>In the world of application security, a <a href="https://nordpass.com/blog/pepper-password/#:~:text=Pros%20and%20cons-,What%20is%20a%20password%20pepper%3F,database%20along%20with%20the%20hashes." target="_blank">password pepper</a> is a secret value added to a password before hashing.</p>
            <p>Password peppering is a technique to add an additional layer of user security by incorporating these secret values into the password workflow without storing the value of these peppers in any database.</p>
            <p>This technique can be applied in a simple fashion to your own individual password security process.</p>
            <p>I use a manual password pepper workflow for my most sensitive online accounts, primarily financial and banking logins. The process is very simple:</p>
            <p>I already have a unique, strong and complex password for each of my financial and banking accounts, which are stored within my secure Bitwarden password manager.</p>
            <p>For all of these financial logins, I have added the same 3 digit string to the end of each password. The full password with the 3 digit “pepper” is saved as my official credentials with each respective financial institution, but the pepper portion is excluded from my password manager.</p>
            <p>When I log in to a financial account, I can simply fill in the username and password from my password manager, then manually add my secret 3 digit pepper to the end of the password to gain access.</p>
            <p>This password pepper strategy adds additional security and peace of mind to managing my most sensitive accounts. It is intended primarily as an answer to the question, “What if a worst case scenario played out, and all of my sensitive data was leaked from my password manager?”</p>
            <h3>5) Spread grassroots security awareness</h3>
            <p>When it comes to cybersecurity, you are only as strong as your weakest link.</p>
            <p>You may personally have a solid password strategy in place, but it only takes one other member of your team or household with poor digital hygiene to bring down the whole ship.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve established your own robust password process, turn focus towards your fellow colleagues and family members and help them do the same.</p>
            <p>By securing ourselves and those around us at the grassroots level, we can work towards weaving cybersecurity best practices and continuous improvement into the cultural fabric of our households and organizations.</p>
            <div class="line-break"></div>
            <p>In our modern world filled with ever-growing digital logins and passwords, these tactics can help secure your most precious data from bad actors.</p>
            <p>There are several more tactics that can be employed for password security, as well as deeper and more complex strategies within these 5 focus areas. Conducting your own research and staying on top of evolving best practices is important to maintain and improve your security posture.</p>
