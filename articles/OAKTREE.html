            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>I recently completed a project called Company Home Page with Flexbox as part of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer" target="_blank">Codecademy’s Full Stack Engineer Career Path</a>. The project assignment was to design and build a home landing page for a business using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on CSS Flexbox techniques.</p>
            <p>I chose to spin up a fictitious cybersecurity consulting business called OAKTREE to use as the basis for my website. This article covers the tools, processes and techniques I utilized to build the OAKTREE brand and landing page.</p>
            <p>You can check out the <a href="https://user5142.github.io/OAKTREE/" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/user5142/OAKTREE" target="_blank">Github repository</a> of my finished project to go along with this article.</p>
            <h1>Execution</h1>
            <h2>Part I: Brand</h2>
            <h2>Company</h2>
            <p>The fictitious cybersecurity consulting company that I created for this project was largely inspired by the philosophies of Dan Geer.</p>
            <p>Geer is a security analyst, writer and CIO of In-Q-Tel, the non-profit venture arm of the CIA. He is a security industry veteran and <a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/06/dan-geers-10-cybersecurity-best-practices/" target="_blank">thought leader</a>, and places particular emphasis on designing “off-the-grid” backups to keep our critical infrastructure running when the internet goes down.</p>
            <p>I thought it would be cool to devise a cybersecurity consulting business that specializes in these “off-the-grid” backup strategies, and thus OAKTREE (Offline Alternatives Known To Rectify Entropic Events) was born.</p>
            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>I first discovered <a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_blank">Color Hunt</a> from one of Shantanu Kumar’s awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF4_T7yMTOA" target="_blank">design videos</a>, and it has since become my favorite tool for finding crisp and cohesive color palettes.</p>
            <p>I felt that a clean, calm and professional color scheme would fit best with the OAKTREE brand. I used the Random feature on Color Hunt and scrolled through palettes until I found a nice blue/green/off-white combination that fit the bill.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/colorhunt-screenshot.png" alt="Color Hunt palette screenshot">
            </div>
            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p>I employed the use of <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/" target="_blank">DALL•E 2</a> to expedite my logo design process. DALL•E 2 is an artificial intelligence tool created by <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a> that can generate images based off of written prompts.</p>
            <p>Here is a breakdown of the process I followed to create the OAKTREE logo utilizing the amazing capabilities of DALL•E 2 and Adobe Illustrator:</p>
            <p>1) Define the vision</p>
            <p>I first decided on what kind of logo mark I was looking for: a simple acorn vector.</p>
            <p>2) Enter prompts</p>
            <p>It can take a few tries and some tinkering to come up with a prompt that yields pleasing results from DALL•E.</p>
            <p>Only my sixth prompt attempt, DALL•E generated a result that I was happy with: a simple and visually appealing image of an acorn that would fit perfectly as a logo mark for the OAKTREE brand.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/DALL-E-acorn-screenshot.png" alt="DALL•E 2 generated acorns">
            </div>
            <p>3) Vectorize</p>
            <p>This step requires access to Adobe Illustrator, but could be performed using a variety of other tools and techniques.</p>
            <p>I imported the DALL•E generated acorn PNG file into Adobe Illustrator, then performed Image Trace to vectorize it.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/acorn-image-trace.png" alt="acorn image trace">
            </div>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/acorn-image-trace2.png" alt="acorn image trace">
            </div>
            <p>I then deleted all unnecessary vector components, stylized the acorn with the brand colors, picked a font and added the OAKTREE text, and that’s all she wrote. The logo was completed from start to finish in under 20 minutes.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Part II: Landing Page</h2>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>I used Adobe Illustrator to create a mockup of the OAKTREE landing page, working off of the color scheme and brand logo created in Part I. </p>
            <p>I only focused on a desktop sized mockup and did not worry about the design of smaller screen sizes. I also did not create any sort of style guide and instead selected fonts, layouts and component styles on the fly to save time.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/OAKTREE-website-mockup.png" alt="OAKTREE website mockup">
            </div>
            <p>I utilized simple Google Image searches to find visually appealing photos for the first two sections of the site.</p>
            <p>One of the requirements for this project was to include photos of company employees on the website. To accomplish this in a quick and effective manner, I again turned to artificial intelligence and leveraged a website called <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/" target="_blank">This Person Does Not Exist.</a></p>
            <p>Created by <a href="https://lucidrains.github.io/" target="_blank">Phil Wang</a>, TPDNE utilizes generative AI to render hyper-realistic images of people who do not actually exist. Simply visit the website and refresh the page, and a new AI generated human will appear.</p>
            <p>Using TPDNE, I was able to quickly accrue six high quality images of people who looked like they might work for a cybersecurity consulting firm, assign them a name and title, and the task was complete. It’s a bit eerie how realistic and believable these AI generated humans can appear to be.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>With the mockup design complete, I was ready to dive into the development phase. I utilized the handy Live Server plugin within VSCode to launch live previews of the landing page as I built out the HTML and CSS code.</p>
            <p>Per the project guidelines, I relied heavily on CSS Flexbox techniques in the development of the site. I also utilized media queries to optimize the site across screen sizes.</p>
            <p>You can view the final result of the OAKTREE <a href="https://user5142.github.io/OAKTREE/" target="_blank">landing page</a> and check out the site’s <a href="https://github.com/user5142/OAKTREE" target="_blank">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
            <h1>Insights</h1>
            <p>This project was a great opportunity to practice converting a design mockup to a developed website. Putting in the extra effort to create a fictitious brand with a highly realistic look and feel was very worthwhile. It made the project feel like a real world web developer assignment.</p>
            <p>I continue to be amazed by AI tools like DALL•E 2 and TPDNE and find them extremely useful to incorporate into my design processes.</p>
